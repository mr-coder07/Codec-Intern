# National-Stock-Exchange-Data-Analysis

In this project, I analyzed the top 20 stocks on the National Stock Exchange of India using Python and Jupyter Notebook. I used the NSEpy library to extract 5 years of historical data for these stocks, ensuring the data was clean and preprocessed for accurate analysis. I implemented a moving average crossover strategy to generate buy and sell signals and backtested the strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance. Key performance metrics calculated included Total Returns, Annualized Returns, Maximum Drawdown, Sharpe Ratio, Win/Loss Ratio, and Number of Trades Executed. 
I visualized these metrics through charts and graphs to assess the strategy's effectiveness and its correlation with market conditions. Based on the analysis, I proposed improvements to enhance the strategy. This project provided valuable insights into trading strategy effectiveness, aiding in informed decision-making and strategy refinement.

1. Data Acquisition and Preparation 
In financial analysis, accurate and comprehensive data acquisition is crucial. The goal is 
to gather historical price data for top-performing stocks to implement and evaluate 
trading strategies. For this report, we focus on the top 20 stocks listed on the National 
Stock Exchange of India (NSE) based on market capitalization. 
NSEpy Library: 
The NSEpy library is used to extract historical and real-time data from the NSE’s 
website. Designed with simplicity in mind, this library provides an easy-to-use API for 
retrieving financial data. Python, in conjunction with the NSEpy library, facilitates 
efficient data analysis and manipulation. 
Steps:
1. Stock Selection: Identify the top 20 stocks by market capitalization. This ensures 
that we are working with the most influential and widely traded stocks in the 
market. 
2. Historical Data: Retrieve daily historical price data for these stocks over the past 5 
years. This data typically includes essential fields such as open, high, low, close, 
and volume. 
3. Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and 
ensure consistency. This step is vital to ensure the accuracy and reliability of 
subsequent analyses. 
2. Strategy Implementation and Backtesting 
Theory:
A trading strategy is a systematic approach to making trading decisions. For this report, a 
simple moving average crossover strategy is employed. This strategy is based on the 
concept of using moving averages to identify potential buy and sell signals. 
Python and NSEpy Integration: 
Python is a powerful tool for data analysis, and the NSEpy library enhances this 
capability by providing access to essential financial data. The main objective of NSEpy is 
to provide analysis-ready data-series that integrate seamlessly with Python’s scipy stack, 
which includes libraries for scientific and technical computing. 
Steps:
1. Strategy Implementation: 
The moving average crossover strategy involves two moving averages: a shortterm and a long-term moving average. Buy and sell signals are generated when the 
short-term moving average crosses above or below the long-term moving average. 
2. Backtesting: 
Apply the strategy to historical data to evaluate its performance. Backtesting 
simulates how the strategy would have performed in the past, providing insights 
into its effectiveness. 
3. Performance Metrics: 
Calculate key performance metrics to assess the strategy: 
o Total Returns: The cumulative return achieved by the strategy over the test 
period. 
Formula: (Total Profit) / (Total Position Size)
o Annualized Returns: The return adjusted to a yearly basis, providing a 
clearer view of long-term performance. 
o Maximum Drawdown: The largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio 
value, indicating the risk of the strategy. 
o Sharpe Ratio: A measure of risk-adjusted return, comparing the strategy's 
excess return to its volatility. 
o Win/Loss Ratio: The ratio of profitable trades to losing trades, reflecting the 
effectiveness of the strategy in generating gains. 
o Number of Trades Executed: The total number of trades made by the 
strategy, providing context for the strategy's activity level. 
3. Analysis and Insights 
Analyzing the results of the backtesting phase helps in understanding the strengths and 
weaknesses of the trading strategy. This involves visualizing the performance metrics and 
correlating them with market conditions. 
Steps:
1. Visualization: 
Create charts and graphs to visualize key performance metrics. This helps in easily 
comparing performance across different stocks and metrics. 
2. Performance Analysis: 
Evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy based on the calculated metrics. Identify 
which stocks and metrics show strong performance and which do not. 
3. Market Conditions: 
Discuss how different market conditions, such as bull (rising) and bear (falling) 
markets, affect the strategy’s performance. Understanding this relationship helps in 
assessing the robustness of the strategy. 
4. Strategy Improvement: 
Based on the analysis, propose modifications to improve the strategy. This may 
involve adjusting parameters, incorporating additional indicators, or refining the 
trading rules.
 
Conclusion:
A well-executed analysis of historical stock data and backtesting of trading strategies 
provides valuable insights into their effectiveness. By leveraging comprehensive data and 
performance metrics, traders can make informed decisions and enhance their trading 
strategies.
